# pacer

Want to hit a specific target time in a hilly foot race?

This small python script might be helpful to you.

It reads distance and altitude data from a JSON file and outputs pdf files with detailed pacing info.

Still work in progress... More details soon...

For now visit [ctlp_2016](ctlp_2016) for sample outputs or [http://urupica.github.io/pacer/](http://urupica.github.io/pacer/) for a race I used the pace tables for.
